# Gridfinity-Documentation
Documentation relating to the Gridfinity project by Zach Freedman to provide designers with the information to make cool things
Description

Gridfinity is a modular storage system designed by Zach Freedman and a video explaination can be found here: 

the Gridfinity site can be found here:

This page will inculde techinical drawings to explain gridfinity and make it easier for people to design components that conform to the standards and ensure compatibility. As well as introducing GridfinitySS which is a slight modification to the orifinal spec that is completely compatable but optimized for a 0.2 mm layer height and 0.4 mm nozzle the most standard size. 

# Overview 
There are many drawings here and it is not the most efficient way to create an engineering drawing but it is meant to provide the most amount of information and from different perspectives to make sure the most amount of people can understand it. 

# Original Spec

### Bin Stacking lip
This section includes the profile of the stacking lip. There are two option and both work fine. 

For the rounded Staking lip it is not hte exact same as the one is Zach's original models but close and easier to recreate. What you do at the top doesn't really matter as long as everything else is the same.
